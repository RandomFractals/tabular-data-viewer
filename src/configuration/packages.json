    "description": "This dataset belongs to the functional MRI study entitled: 'Decoding social knowledge in the human brain'. The stud addressed how the brain maps different aspects of social information. We focused on two key dimensions of social knowledge: affect and likableness. Thirty participants were presented with audio definitions, half referring to affective  (e.g. empathetic) and half to non-affective concepts  (e.g. intelligent). Orthogonally, half of the concepts were highly likable (e.g. sincere) and half were socially undesirable (e.g. liar). We used a support vector machine to delineate how both concept dimensions are represented in a set of 9 \\textit{a priori} brain regions defined from previous meta-analyses on semantic and social cognition. We show that average decoding in semantic regions (e.g. lateral temporal lobe, inferior frontal gyrus, and precuneus) outperformed social ROIs (e.g. insula and anterior cingulate), with the lateral temporal lobe containing the highest amount of information about the affect and likableness of social concepts. We also found that the insula had a bias towards affect while the likableness dimension was better represented in anterior cingulate cortex. Our results do not support a modular view of social knowledge representation. They rather indicate that the brain representation of social concepts implicates a distributed network of regions that involves 'domain-specific' social cognitive systems, but with a greater dependence on language-semantic processing."

The dataset includes shoe name, brand, price, and more. Each shoe will have an entry for each price found for it and some shoes may have multiple entries. Note that this is a sample of a large dataset. The full dataset is available through Datafiniti. What You Can Do with This Data You can use this data to  determine brand markups, pricing strategies, and trends for luxury shoes . E.g.: What is the average price of each distinct brand listed? Which brands have the highest prices?   Which ones have the widest distribution of prices? Is there a typical price distribution (e.g., normal) across brands or within specific brands? Further processing data would also let you: Correlate specific product features with changes in price. You can cross-reference this data with a sample of our  Women's Shoe Prices  to see if there are any differences between women's brands and men's brands. Data Schema A full schema for the data is available in our  support documentation . About Datafiniti Datafiniti provides instant access to web data.

The JRC-PPDB-OPEN database is a first attempt towards a more detailed and coherent, albeit still incomplete, dataset of European power plants.

What You Can Do with This Data You can use this data to  determine brand markups, pricing strategies, and trends for luxury shoes . E.g.: What is the average price of each distinct brand listed? Which brands have the highest prices?   Which ones have the widest distribution of prices? Is there a typical price distribution (e.g., normal) across brands or within specific brands? Further processing data would also let you: Correlate specific product features with changes in price. You can cross-reference this data with a sample of our  Women's Shoe Prices  to see if there are any differences between women's brands and men's brands.

Departmental expenditure data in previous financial years have been aligned with the budget and programme structures of departments as they are structured in the current Medium Term Expenditure Framework. This means that the structure of historical expenditure data for a department, may not necessarily reflect the same structure of that department when expenditure was incurred during a particular financial year. This may be due to functions shifts which may have occurred within a particular department or a general change in a department’s budget programme structures (BPS) as departments are afforded an opportunity before the start of the Budget to change their BPS.This is to ensure a more economical, efficient and effective delivery of public services and performance by the department as a whole."

    "description": "Clinical and MRI data from the ISPY1 clinical trial of patients with breast cancer Description and Objectives The goal of this project is to improve the prediction of clinical outcomes to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.Currently, most patients with breast cancer undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which is aimed to reduce the tumor size (burden) before surgery to remove the tumor or the entire breast. Some of the patients response completely to the therapy and the patient does not present any residual tumor at the time of surgery. On the other hand, some patients have residual disease at the time of surgery and further treatment is required. Data Source These data for  222 patients  treated for breast cancer was obtained from the cancer imaging archive and the Breast Imaging Research Program at UCSF, in collaboration with ACRIN, CALGB, the I-SPY TRIAL, and TCIA. More details  here . Predictors of clinical outcomes Two types of data are available for this project: Clinical Data as a XLS file with the following fields: Age  (Years) Race , encoded as: 1 = Caucasian 3 = African American 4 = Asian 5 = Native Hawaiian 6 = American Indian 50 = Multiple race Estrogen Receptor Status ( ER+ ) encoded as: 1 = Positive 0 = Negative Blank = Indeterminate Progesterone Receptor Status ( PR+ ) encoded as: 1 = Positive 0 = Negative Blank = Indeterminate Hormone Receptor Status ( ER+ ) 1 = Positive 0 = Negative Blank = Indeterminate Bilateral Breast Cancer ( Bilateral ): 1 = Cancer Detected on both breasts 0 = Cancer Detected in a single breast Breast with major or single Tumor ( Laterality ): 1 = Left breast 2 = Right breast Largest tumor dimension at Baseline estimated by MRI ( MRI_LD_Baseline ) Continous variable Largest tumor dimension 1-3 days after NAC estimated by MRI ( MRI_LD_1_3dAC ) Continous variable Largest tumor dimension between cycles of NAC estimated by MRI ( MRI_LD_Int_Reg ) Continous variable Largest tumor dimension before surgery estimated by MRI ( MRI_LD_PreSurg ) Continous variable MRI with contrast at three time points: Modalities: \t\tMR, SEG Number of Patients: 222 Number of Studies: \t847 Number of Images: \t386,528 Images Size (GB)\t76.2 GigaByte Clinical Outcomes Several clinical outcomes are described in this data set. Survival Status ( Survival ): 7 = Alive 8 = Dead 9 = Lost to follow up Length of Survival ( Survival_length ): Days from study entry to death or last follow-up Recurrence-free survival ( RFS ): days from from NCAC start until progression or death Recurrence-free survival indicator ( RFS_code ) progression or death (1), removed from survival curve (0) Pathologic Complete Response ( PCR ) post-neoadjuvant ?: 1 = Yes 0 = No Lost (Blank) Residual Cancer Burden class ( RCB ): 0 = RCB index (Class 0) 1 = RCB index less than or equal to 1.36 (Class I) 2 = RCB index greater than 1.36 or equal to 3.28  (Class II) 3 = III, RCB index greater than 3.28 (Class III) Blank = unavailable or no surgery"

    "description": "Tweets of Congress from Alex Litel About Tweets of Congress is  Alex Litel 's attempt to collate the entirety of Congress’ daily Twitter output using an automated process that checks Twitter on a fixed interval. Archives are available on Github and in JSON form. You can find JSON datasets linked in posts or in  Github repository . Due to size constraints, archives will be limited at some tbd point.  Tweets of Congress is the front-end portion of a project collecting the daily tweets of both houses of Congress, encompassing 1,000+ campaign, office, committee and party accounts. It's designed to be used in concert with the Congressional Tweet Automator, which creates the content in this repo (among other things). For more information on the process of how everything is compiled, visit the aforementioned repo for the Automator. The collected tweets are available as JSON datasets, which are generated around midnight EST. You can find them in this repository inside the data folder, and they are also linked at the site. To do a little more with the datasets, you may want to check out the users-filtered.json dataset -- which contains metadata for all the accounts the project follows for tweet collection -- in the automation repo. Due to size constraints, archives will cut off at some point, and because the automation portion interfaces with low-level Github and Git features, the commit history may be volatile and subject to change. Also, most commits in this repo will come from an account that is completely automated. This site is open-source, so feel free to fork or whatever to your heart's content. For any issues or other feedback, file an issue, make a pull request, or send me an email.
